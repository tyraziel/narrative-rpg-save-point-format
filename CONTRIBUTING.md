## 💡 Ways You Can Contribute

## 📐 Style Guidelines

- All official file types must follow the `<Name>.<Type>.md` naming convention (e.g., `Zeke.CS.md`, `Arc2.NRSP.md`)
- Use standard Markdown formatting (headings, tables, lists) with readable indentation
- Keep emotional narrative and mechanical details clearly separated when possible
- Respect modularity: files should be individually meaningful but bundle-compatible
