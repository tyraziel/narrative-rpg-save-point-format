## Narrative RPG Save Point Format (NRSP) – Contributor Covenant v2.1 (The Storyteller’s Oath)

This project is governed by the principles of respectful storytelling, collaborative and iterative design, and inclusive narrative building.

---

## 🌐 Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of the NRSP format pledge to make participation in our project and community a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of character level or system preference.

We are committed to building and preserving a collaborative, creative space where ideas can be safely shared and iterated.

## 📖 Our Principles

- **Respect the narrative** – Every contributor brings a story. Treat their input with care.
- **No railroading** – Disagreements are natural; exclusion, harassment, or gatekeeping are not.
- **Roll with advantage** – Be encouraging. Uplift new contributors and support learning.
- **Modularity over dogma** – There’s room for multiple playstyles, tools, and forks.
- **Stay in character** – Keep the tone collaborative, curious, and in the spirit of storytelling.
- ""Respect the tavern rules** - Tell bold stories, but keep them suitable for the whole adventuring party.  No need for overly graphic, extreme or sexual in nature.
